# Hey Fluorescent!

### Product page coding challenge notes

I chose to go with a React build because I've been working with it for my last few projects and wanted to give myself the best shot at getting to some of the stretch work.

I've deployed on github pages and started the project with that process to make sure I could focus on more styling as I reached my time limit. I didn't want any big surprises at the end!

I've really enjoyed this project and while I see a lot of room for improvement, it was a great task to think through. During the process I was considering what would be required to pull in to make the images, copy, and details dynamic and pulled from a database or admin. This is largely how I would approach something at this stage, by starting with a validation check before iterating on dynamic content!

I would appreciate any feedback. My chat with Kelsey included mention of the BEM model for CSS structure which I checked out but wasn't able to integrate right away. I'll be checking that out more for sure.

Thanks team!
